- We use `sqlc` to generate functions from sql queries.
  - Which means do not edit any files in the older `internal/repository/`
  - If adding new sql query functions add them in `query/` folder in the related file
  - The code is then generated using `sqlc generate`
- Use `sqlite` as the database so all query should work with `sqlite` dialect
- Uses goose for database migrations, which are run automatically on startup
  - Migrations are placed in `database/migrations` and uses a incremental number for each migration
